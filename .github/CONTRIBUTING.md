consisting of 2 components:

1. add here
2. add here


For all contributions, a CLA (Contributor License Agreement) needs to be signed [here](https://cla-assistant.io/Test-at-scalehq/Test-at-scale) before (or after) the pull request has been submitted. A bot will prompt contributors to sign the CLA via a pull request comment, if necessary.


### Set up your branch to write code

We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), so all code changes happen through pull requests. [Learn more.](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/) 

 1. Please make sure there is an issue associated with the work that you're doing. If it doesn‚Äôt exist, [create an issue.](https://github.com/Test-at-scalehq/Test-at-scale/issues/new/choose)
 2. If you're working on an issue, please comment that you are doing so to prevent duplicate work by others also.
 3. Fork the repo and create a new branch from the `dev` branch.
 4. Please name the branch as <span style="color:grey">issue-[issue-number]-[issue-name(optional)]</span> or <span style="color:grey">feature-[feature-number]‚Äì[feature-name(optional)]</span>. For example, if you are fixing Issue #205 name your branch as <span style="color:grey">issue-205 or  issue-205-selectbox-handling-changes</span>
 5. Squash your commits and refer to the issue using `Fix #<issue-no>` in the commit message, at the start.
 6. Rebase `dev` with your branch and push your changes.
 7. Raise a pull request against the staging branch of the main repository.


### üè°  Setup for local development

Refer to [this](https://Test-at-scale.com/docs/contributing/setup-dev-environment/) document to learn how to set up a dev environment.

&emsp;

## **Committing code**

The repository contains two important (protected) branches.

 * main contains the code that is tested and released. 
 * dev  contains recent developments under testing. This branch is set as the default branch, and all pull requests should be made against this branch.

Pull requests should be made against the <span style="color:grey">dev</span> branch. <span style="color:grey">staging</span> contains all of the new features and fixes that are under testing and ready to go out in the next release.
